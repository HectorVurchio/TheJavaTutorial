the files operations of FileOperations.java
will be executed.
This is an example of Java input IO
al the code is typed for me
but the source is The Java Tutorial
I'm acting as though a were the stream
the tutorial is the source and this notepad is the target
all data is consumed while printing to a file.
This is the file used to test CopyBytes class
the code comes from The Java Tutorial from Oracle
we will be trying to perform a stream operation from
here to a target file equally named target.txt
